# Ready Tensor Publication Explorer

A powerful RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) powered Q&A assistant designed to help users quickly find and understand information from Ready Tensor's AI/ML publication collection. This intelligent system combines advanced document processing, semantic search, and AI-generated responses to provide accurate, context-aware answers about artificial intelligence and machine learning topics.

## Overview

The Ready Tensor Publication Explorer is an innovative question-answering system that leverages state-of-the-art AI technology to make AI/ML knowledge more accessible. Built specifically for Ready Tensor's publication database, this tool addresses the challenge of quickly finding relevant information across a large collection of technical documents.

**What it does:**

- Processes and indexes Ready Tensor's AI/ML publications using advanced text chunking techniques
- Converts text into high-dimensional vector embeddings for semantic similarity search
- Uses retrieval-augmented generation to provide accurate, context-aware answers
- Presents information through an intuitive web interface that requires no technical expertise

**Why it's useful:**

- **Time-saving**: Instantly find relevant information without manually searching through dozens of publications
- **Intelligent**: Goes beyond keyword matching to understand the semantic meaning of your questions
- **Accurate**: Provides answers based on actual publication content with source attribution
- **Accessible**: Simple web interface makes AI/ML knowledge accessible to both technical and non-technical users

## Installation

Follow these step-by-step instructions to set up the Ready Tensor Publication Explorer on your local machine:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- OpenAI API key (get one at [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YanCotta/rag_publication_explorer.git
cd rag_publication_explorer
```

### Step 2: Create and Activate a Python Virtual Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies

```bash
# Upgrade pip to latest version
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install all required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 4: Create a .env File and Add Your OPENAI_API_KEY

```bash
# Create environment file from template
cp .env.template .env

# Edit the .env file and add your OpenAI API key
# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE' with your actual OpenAI API key
OPENAI_API_KEY='your-actual-openai-api-key-here'
```

**Important**: Never commit your actual API key to version control. The .env file is already included in .gitignore for security.

### Step 5: Verify Installation

```bash
# Test the installation
python -c "import streamlit, langchain, openai, faiss; print('‚úÖ Installation successful!')"
```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

Once installation is complete, start the Ready Tensor Publication Explorer by running:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application will automatically:

1. Load and process the Ready Tensor publication database
2. Generate embeddings and create the vector search index
3. Launch a web browser with the interactive interface
4. Display at `http://localhost:8501`

### Interacting with the Interface

The web interface provides an intuitive way to explore Ready Tensor's AI/ML knowledge base:

1. **Ask Questions**: Type your question in the text input box
2. **Get AI Answers**: Receive comprehensive answers based on the publication content
3. **View Sources**: See which specific publications informed each answer
4. **Explore Content**: Use the expandable sections to read relevant excerpts
5. **Continue Conversations**: Ask follow-up questions that build on previous responses

### Sample Questions

Here are some example questions you can ask to explore the system's capabilities:

**General Questions:**

- "What publications discuss RAG?"
- "Summarize the article on PEP8 style guides"
- "What are the main benefits of retrieval-augmented generation?"

**Technical Questions:**

- "How do I implement effective document chunking strategies?"
- "What embedding models work best for RAG applications?"
- "How can I add memory to RAG applications for better conversations?"

**Ready Tensor Specific:**

- "What does Ready Tensor recommend for machine learning project structure?"
- "What are the key evaluation metrics discussed in the publications?"
- "What coding standards and best practices are mentioned?"

### Advanced Usage

**Command Line Interface:**

The project also includes a command-line interface for advanced users:

```bash
# Process data only
python main.py --data

# Generate embeddings
python main.py --embeddings

# Test the RAG system
python main.py --test

# Complete setup
python main.py --setup
```
